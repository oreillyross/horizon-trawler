Lebanon's Cabinet endorsed Monday the final draft budget to be submitted to Parliament for ratification, as pressure mounts on the small Mediterranean country to get its finances in order.

The budget, one of the "most austere in the history of Lebanon" as Prime Minister Saad Hariri recently said, features a number of measures to raise revenues and decrease spending.

Lebanon's budget deficit, which ballooned to 11.5 percent in 2018, will be reduced to 7.5 percent, Information Minister Jamal Jarrah said. 

To bolster the state's coffers, the Cabinet endorsed the second tax hike in two years on the interest earned on deposits and government-issued treasury bills and bonds, much to the ire of the banking sector.
